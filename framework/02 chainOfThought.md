# Chain of Thought Prompting Framework

## Overview
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that encourages LLMs to break down their reasoning into a logical sequence of steps. This approach significantly improves problem-solving, mathematical reasoning, and decision-making capabilities by guiding the AI to explain its thought process. 

## Best Practices for Chain of Thought Prompting
- **Explicitly Request Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Use phrases like ***Explain step-by-step*** or ***Walk through the logic***. 
- **Encourage Logical Decomposition**: Ask the model to break down problems into smaller parts. 
- **Use Few-Shot Examples**: Provide examples where reasoning steps are explicitly shown. 
- **Iterate for Complex Queries**: Ask follow-up questions to refine responses. 
- **Specify the Type of Reasoning Needed**: Indicate if the reasoning should be mathematical, logical, or cause-and-effect. 

## Examples

### Basic Step-by-Step Reasoning
```
Q: If a train leaves City A at 3 PM traveling at 60 mph, and another train leaves City B at 4 PM traveling at 80 mph toward City A, when will they meet if the cities are 300 miles apart?

A: 

    1. The first train travels for 1 hour before the second train departs, covering 60 miles.
    2. The remaining distance between the trains is 240 miles.
    3. The combined speed of both trains is 60 + 80 = 140 mph.
    4. Time to meet = Distance / Speed = 240 / 140 ≈ 1.71 hours.
    5. The trains will meet around 5:43 PM.
```

### Logical Deduction
```
Q: If all cats are mammals and some mammals are carnivores, can we conclude that all cats are carnivores?

A: 

    1. All cats are mammals (given).
    2. Some mammals are carnivores (given).
    3. However, this does not mean that all mammals, including cats, are carnivores.
    4. Therefore, the statement that all cats are carnivores cannot be concluded as true.
```

### Incorrect Step-by-Step Reasoning
```
Q: A train leaves City A at 3 PM traveling at 60 mph, and another train leaves City B at 4 PM traveling at 80 mph toward City A. When will they meet if the cities are 300 miles apart?

A: 

    1. The first train travels for 1 hour before the second train departs, covering 60 miles.
    2. The remaining distance between the trains is 240 miles.
    3. The combined speed of both trains is 60 + 80 = 140 mph.
    4. Time to meet = Distance / Speed = 300 / 140 ≈ 2.14 hours.
    5. The trains will meet around 6:08 PM.
```

#### Issue:
- The calculation in Step 4 is incorrect. The correct remaining distance is 240 miles, not 300 miles.

### Illogical Deduction
```
Q: If all cats are mammals and some mammals are carnivores, can we conclude that all cats are carnivores?

A: 

    1. All cats are mammals (given).
    2. Some mammals are carnivores (given).
    3. Since cats are mammals, they must be carnivores.
```

#### Issue: 
- This reasoning is flawed. Just because some mammals are carnivores does not mean all mammals, including cats, are carnivores.

## Limitations of Chain of Thought Framework
- **Longer Response Time**: Step-by-step reasoning can increase response latency.
- **Over-Elaboration**: Sometimes, the model might provide unnecessary details.
- **Potential Hallucinations**: The AI might create incorrect reasoning steps if not properly guided.

## Improving Chain of Thought Prompts
- **Provide Clear Context**: Ensure that the model understands the type of reasoning expected.
- **Set Constraints**: Ask for reasoning in a limited number of steps to avoid unnecessary elaboration.
- **Verify Intermediate Steps**: If using AI for problem-solving, cross-check intermediate results.
